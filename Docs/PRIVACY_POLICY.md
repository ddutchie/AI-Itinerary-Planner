# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 04 September 2025  
**Last Updated:** 04 September 2025

## Introduction

AI Travel Itinerary Planner ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our approach to data privacy when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.

## No Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or process any personal data.**

Your privacy is our top priority. Our app is designed with a privacy-first approach:

- **No user accounts required** - Use the app without creating an account
- **No personal data transmission** - Only anonymous travel preferences are sent to AI services
- **No tracking** - We don't track your usage, location, or behavior
- **No analytics** - We don't collect analytics or usage statistics
- **No personal information** - We don't collect names, emails, or any personal details

## How the App Works

**AI-Powered Itinerary Generation:**
- Travel preferences (destination, dates, budget, interests) are sent to AI services
- No personal identifying information is transmitted
- AI services receive only anonymous travel requirements
- Generated itineraries are returned and stored locally on your device
- No user accounts or personal data are associated with requests

**Premium Subscriptions:**
- Premium purchases are processed entirely through Apple App Store or Google Play Store
- We receive no personal information from these transactions
- Subscription status is managed by the app stores, not by us

## Third-Party Services

**App Store Platforms:**
- Apple App Store and Google Play Store handle all payment processing
- We do not receive any personal or payment information
- Governed by respective platform privacy policies:
  - Apple: https://www.apple.com/privacy/
  - Google Play: https://policies.google.com/privacy

**AI Services:**
- Travel preferences are sent to AI services for itinerary generation
- Only anonymous travel parameters are transmitted (destination, dates, budget, interests)
- No personal identifying information is included in these requests
- AI services do not receive any user account information or personal data

**No Other Third-Party Integration:**
- We do not use analytics services
- We do not use advertising networks
- We do not integrate with social media platforms
- We do not use crash reporting services that collect personal data

## Your Privacy Rights

Since we don't collect any personal data, traditional data rights don't apply. However, you have complete control over your app experience:

**Complete Privacy Control:**
- All your trip data remains on your device only
- Delete the app to remove all information permanently
- No need to request data deletion from us (we don't have any)
- No data portability needed (everything stays with you)

**Subscription Management:**
- Manage premium subscriptions directly through App Store settings
- Cancel recurring subscriptions at any time through your app store account
- We have no access to your subscription information or personal details

## Children's Privacy

Our App is safe for users of all ages since we don't collect any personal information. There is no personal data collection that would concern parents or guardians.

## International Data Transfers

Since we don't collect, store, or transfer any personal data, international data transfer regulations don't apply to our app. All app functionality remains local to your device regardless of your location.

## California Privacy Rights

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), you have the right to know that:

- We do not collect personal information
- We do not sell personal information 
- We do not share personal information with third parties
- There is no personal information to delete or access

Since no personal data is collected, CCPA rights related to data access, deletion, and portability are not applicable.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will:

- Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Notify users through the App when possible
- For material changes, provide prominent notice

Your continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

## Data Security

Since we don't collect any data, there are no data security concerns related to our servers or databases. Your information security depends entirely on your device's security, which you control.
